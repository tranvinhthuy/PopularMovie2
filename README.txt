Add the API key value to the parameter "final static String API_KEY" in NetworkUtils.java

Code to detect screen size in dp get from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6465680/how-to-determine-the-screen-width-in-terms-of-dp-or-dip-at-runtime-in-android

Sorry about the package name is still ".popularmovie1". I tried to rename the whole project but it causes some messy error forcing me to removed the binding layout part. Hope it is ok.

Sorry I don't have much time to polish because the submit deadline for participate in Google IO trip draw is very near :)

Thank you!
